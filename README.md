# Blackjack Game
This is a React using Hooks and TypeScript for a blackjack game. 

You can find the full list of Frontends and APIs [here.](https://github.com/wley3337/blackjack-game) 
## Goal

* This will use multiple types for backend servers with the same user experience


## Backends:

* Rails v 6.0.0 - current api

## Install instructions:
   * Update `./redux/actions/index.ts` `BASE_URL` accurately for your backend service

## Notes:
   * Wonderful Blog by [Kittiphat Srilomasak](https://medium.com/@peatiscoding/typescripts-with-redux-redux-thunk-recipe-fcce4ffca405) on TypeScript React/Redux- some of the practices are out of date it seems, but good starting point.
